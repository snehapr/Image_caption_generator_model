# Image Caption Generator System
1. The project is written using Python and related ML and DL libraries.
2. I have built the custom model which extracts the image as the input and provides the vocabulary code as the output.
3. Based on the score, the caption is calculated for the given input image.
4. In testing_caption_generator file, you can see i have used from random 4-5 images to predict the caption of the image. Almost correctly it has predicted in each of the cases.
