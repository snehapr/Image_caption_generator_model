# Image Caption Generator System
1. The project is written using Python and related ML and DL libraries.
2. I have built the custom model which extracts the image as the input and provides the vocabulary score as the output.
3. Based on the score, the caption is calculated for the given input image.
4. In testing_caption_generator.ipynb file, you can see i have used random 4-5 images to predict the caption of the image.
